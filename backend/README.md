# Backend Node.js + Epxress (MVC) 🛡️

## Development

Use `node` version `12.16.0`

```
nvm install 12.16.0
```

```
nvm use 12.16.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with 

```
npm run start
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:
